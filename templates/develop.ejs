                    <p>
                        Big data: The next frontier for innovation, competition, and productivity.Big Data refers to datasets that grow so large that it is difficult to capture, store, manage, share, analyze and visualize with the typical database software tools. The popular ways to solve big data problems is to break complex problems into smaller pieces, send each piece to a different computer, solve the smaller pieces in parallel, and then pull the results together for analysis. This is the approach used by an open source program called Hadoop and its application programming model, MapReduce Big data types (e.g., location, time-series, and sensor data) require fundamental matrix operations that are not suited to traditional row-store, column-store, or MapReduce.

                    <h2>IoT</h2>
                    <p>
                       The Internet of Things (IoT), sometimes referred to as the Internet of Objects, will change everything â€” including ourselves. This may seem like a bold statement, but consider the impact the Internet already has had on education, communication, business, science, government, and humanity. Clearly, the Internet is one of the most important and powerful creations in all of human history.                       
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now consider that IoT represents the next evolution of the Internet, taking a huge leap in its ability to gather, analyze, and distribute data that we can turn into information, knowledge, and, ultimately, wisdom. In this context, IoT becomes immensely important.
