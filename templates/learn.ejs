                    <h2>IoT</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Internet of Things (IoT), sometimes referred to as the Internet of Objects, will change everything â€” including ourselves. This may seem like a bold statement, but consider the impact the Internet already has had on education, communication, business, science, government, and humanity. Clearly, the Internet is one of the most important and powerful creations in all of human history.                      
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now consider that IoT represents the next evolution of the Internet, taking a huge leap in its ability to gather, analyze, and distribute data that we can turn into information, knowledge and, ultimately, wisdom. In this context, IoT becomes immensely important.
